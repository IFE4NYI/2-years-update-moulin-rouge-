Project Overview

This is a personal project to gain insights into my current company's activities over the past two years and one month. The core focus of this project includes:  

- Analyzing total product sales and identifying items with the highest sales based on price and count.  
- Determining the preferred payment methods used by clerks, represented as a percentage.  
- Counting the number of product categories sold each month and year.  
- Assessing sales trends to identify peak sales months and comparing sales performance over the two-year period.  

Data Collection & Preparation
I began by collecting a raw dataset consisting of 170,033 rows and 22 columns, which was unstructured, uncategorized, and required significant cleaning. The dataset contained various attributes, including product details, sales transactions, and payment records. However, inconsistencies, missing values, and redundant information made it necessary to refine and organize the data before analysis.

To clean and structure the data:  
- Imported the dataset into SQL Server for data cleaning and organization.  
- Categorized items by category for easy analysis.  
- Created a SQL view containing only the most relevant columns.  
- Removed multiple duplicates to ensure data accuracy and integrity.  
- Ensured that distinct values stood out clearly, making the dataset more structured and insightful.  
- Created a new column to classify items into their respective categories for better segmentation.  
- Predicted the null values accordingly to maintain data accuracy and consistency.  

Data Analysis & Visualization
After preparing the data, I migrated it to Power BI for visualization and insights. The following visual elements were created:  

- Sales Analysis: A line and stacked column chart detailing the sum of price/quantity by the list of items.  
- Payment Methods: A pie chart illustrating the distribution of payment methods used by clerks.  
- Category Sales Trends: A matrix table showing the count of sales by category for each year and month.  
- Overall Sales Trends: A line and stacked column chart displaying the count and sum of products sold by year and month.  

Key Takeaways & Next Steps
This project provides valuable insights into sales trends, payment preferences, and category performance over the past two years. The findings can help optimize inventory management, improve sales strategies, and enhance decision-making for the company.  

Future steps may include deeper trend analysis, customer segmentation, and predictive analytics for better forecasting.
